# Copter

It is a flight computer for a VTOL(vertical takeoff and vertical landing), it will make sure the aircraft can hover only with two motors and transition into flight stage with the help of the mpu 6050

upwards of 80USD

This was my first time using esayEDA and earlier I used KiCad, also the first time i used a custom rp2040 board, using the datasheet of a mcu to make sure it works like a whole microcontroller was a fascinating design process. The rp2040 datasheet was really simple to follow and helped a lot as this was my first standalone mcu board, also the first time im use the mpu6050 in smd(non breakout format)
